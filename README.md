# youtube-live-stream-checker

Script to check if a Youtube channel has a current live stream and create an iframe object if it does. 

This script uses the Youtube API v3 to search for a list of live videos based on a channel id. I only take the first result of the query to build the iframe object.

Feel free to improve this script.
